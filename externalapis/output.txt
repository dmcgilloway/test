Ages range from 20 somethings through to 60 somethings – whoever you are there will be like-minded folk you are sure to find something in common with. <br> </span></em></p>\n<p><em><span>Our events include coffee and chat, restaurant meals, films, sporting activities, walks, days out, lively evenings in bars, dancing, live gigs, theatre shows, outdoor pursuits, regular bespoke events and tours and other suggestions that ANY member has. </span></em></p>\n<p><em><span>Why is it so important to be social? More people live alone now than at any other time in history. In the UK some 29% of all households contain just a single occupant (2013 Census). People living alone are far more likely to want to get out and about and enjoy&nbsp;social interaction. This is exactly what we offer. <br> <br> Most of our events are very loosely structured. Event Hosts come up with something they enjoy doing and invite others in the group to join&nbsp;in. If you are new, let Event Hosts know, and they&nbsp;will introduce you to other Members, and, at each event, active members will make you welcome and help you to feel part of the group.&nbsp;</span></em></p>\n<p><em><span>Our group is not for profit, so&nbsp;there are no additional costs to attend events (apart from venue admission&nbsp;fees or&nbsp;charges for meals, etc.),&nbsp;but we would appreciate it if you would make a donation of £5 to support the group and cover running costs - to make a donation just follow the link at "Donations". <br> <br></span><span><strong>Belfast Social Events Group</strong> - the name says it all! Life is a journey so why not make the journey fun and exciting? Social events will get you out of the house, help you to make new friends, go to new places, laugh, dance, and chill out. We are all social beings, and Belfast is the place to join in social events and find good company, good craic, and good times!</span></em></p>\n<p><em><strong><span>Now you can follow us on Twitter:&nbsp; @ BelfastEvent <br>&nbsp; <br> </span></strong></em></p>',

Trainers, step ups etc are not suitable.</b></p>\n<p>Please read the Frequently Asked Questions below, which will probably serve to answer any of your queries. It\'s quite an independent group, but if there\'s anything else you need to know that isn\'t dealt with below, feel free to &lt;a&gt;email me&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a&gt;.&lt;/a&gt;</p>\n<p><b>FAQs &lt;br&gt; </b></p>\n<p><b>Am I fit enough for the walks?</b></p>\n<p>We do various grades of walk from the novice building up their fitness levels, to the seasoned hill walker. Here is our guide. Walks may carry one of the following grades but only as a general guide: Remember, these walks are only for adults.</p>\n<p><img src="http://photos3.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/e/9/8/event_328488792.jpeg"></p>\n<p>&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;</p>\n<p><b>Medical conditions?</b></p>\n<p>If you have a medical condition ie diabetes, allergy etc please make the organiser aware in confidence.</p>\n<p><b>Dogs?</b> &lt;br&gt; Dogs are very welcome in this group.</p>\n<p><b>Age limit ? -</b> You must be 18 to join. The group is not suitable or designed for children.</p>\n<p><b>What if I change my mind about attending a walk?</b></p>\n<p>That\'s no problem! We don\'t keep tabs! Just update your RSVP. There\'s no need to write apologies, or explain and no need to text or call me as I need to keep my phone free for people who are lost or running late. However if you are involved in car sharing, make sure you notify your fellow passengers/driver.</p>\n<p><b>Profile requirements?</b></p>\n<p>For reasons of basic common courtesy to members, pseudo and plain stupid-sounding profile names will not gain online admittance to this group, so join up using something that resembles the name your mother gave you.</p>\n<p><b>How do I get to the meetups?</b></p>\n<p>It is up to members to make their own way to the meetups.There are detailed instructions and a location map of the venue usually supplied in details of each walk posted on the site.</p>\n<p>Members who don\'t drive or who car share usually post up where they are coming from and get transport organised with other drivers in the group. You can arrange then to tip your driver. For longer journeys it\'s at least £5. &lt;br&gt; Please don\'t organise lifts or offer lifts unless you definitely intend to go on a walk.</p>\n<p>&lt;br&gt; <b>Privacy?</b></p>\n<p>Please use your usual worldly discretion when organising lifts or communicating on the site, and be careful of publicly posting your phone, address, car details. Every member can be emailed privately through the site. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; <b>Big fat no nos?</b></p>\n<p>No advertising of any shape or form is allowed on this site either through profile name, profile blurb, on greetings bar or discussion forums, through the email facility or any other means. Walking it is and walking it stays thanks very much!</p>\n<p><b>Trolls?</b> &lt;br&gt; This is neither Facebook nor Twitter. We message each other with courtesy and goodwill at all times. Please respect this very important rule. Anyone posting inappropriate messages will be dealt with by me (by removal or PSNI). So if you are a member please don\'t engage in online exchanges with trolls (they may as a result get your personal email address) - leave them to me.</p>\n<p>Dynamos subscribe to Leave No Trace</p>\n<p><a href="http://www.walkni.com/useful-info/leave-no-trace/"></a></p>\n<p><a href="http://www.walkni.com/useful-info/leave-no-trace/"><img src="http://photos4.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/5/8/6/event_326053702.jpeg"></a></p>\n<p>&lt;br&gt;</p>\n<p>Read \'<a href="http://www.meetup.com/belfasthillstours-com/about/">Pages</a>\' for a fuller explanation of the group.</p>',

So there is no need for mats and no special clothing required.</span></p>\n<p>We are all volunteers of a Community based Charity organisation and have many years of experience in offering free Sahaja Yoga Meditation classes. All across the globe, many are seeking new sources of energy.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, the most transformative energy of all is hiding in plain sight, within us. It\'s natural, sustainable, and infinitely renewable. It\'s called inner kundalini energy. And everyone already has it — everyone!. It is often likened to an inner feminine or motherly energy which automatically knows about us and what is needed to help us restore balance and harmony within our subtle being. It works spontaneously, effortlessly, organically and cannot be paid for.</p>\n<p>The classes are designed to help those attending get into a genuine meditative state, which can be felt tangibly. It is quite effortless and spontaneous.</p>\n<p>The free classes feature introductory talks, video\'s, practical workshops and general question and answer opportunities, making them perfect for seekers trying to establish a state of yoga, and they are available across London most evenings and throughout the UK. The idea is that you don\'t do yoga - you Achieve Yoga!</p>\n<p>Sahaja Yoga Meditation is a simple, time-honored technique. It helps those who enjoy it, reduce stress and increase wellness and health holistically. It brings better focus and helps people become more centered and better balanced. Anyone can do it.</p>\n<p>Founded by Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi, Sahaja Yoga Meditation is a world wide movement for peace and self awakening. All the meetings and classes are free of any charge. Each week we go through simple meditation techniques, often with guided meditations to help reduce stress and achieve the peace of true meditation. We share tips on how to help stay in balance during the day and how to meditate at home.</p>\n<p>The meditation is based on connecting with the inner chakras (energy centres) and balancing the subtle body. The tradition and aims of meditation are explained which in essence is to be in the present with no mental activity or thoughts about the past or the future.</p>\n<p>Occasionally there are 1 day retreats to help those interested, deepen their individual experience and hear advice and tips from those who have been practicing for some time. It’s ultimately all about getting into ‘thoughtless awareness’, a natural state of being.</p>\n<p>We have a web site in London too which you can visit if you are ever there for more info about weekly meetings:<a href="http://www.sahajayogalondon.co.uk/">www.sahajayogalondon.co.uk</a></p>\n<p><a href="http://www.sahajayogalondon.co.uk/"></a>Join us on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.facebook.com/London.Free.Meditation">Facebook</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/SahajL">Twitter</a></p>\n<br>\n<br>',
